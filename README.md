# HTML CSS GIT Challenge: Code Refactor

This module is an odd-numbered module, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This module's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when semantic HTML elements can be found.

* It's done when the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

* It's done when a concise and descriptive title can be found.
